Fetus problems are the major reasons in gynecology for pregnant women's. If the conditions for the fetus inside womb are not appropriate, then there are major chances of health deterioration of the fetus. Cardiotocography (CTG) technique is used to record the fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contractions (UC) simultaneously. In this project, we use PCA to reduce the feature space from 36 components to 20 principle components and reduce the correlation between features. In order to perform Scaling, PCA and building the model, we use Pipeline, and finally run the GridSearchCV to find the best parameters with Cross Validation. The data set is extracted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and classified into a fetal state by means of a normal, suspicious and pathological class that is trained and tested using algorithms and compared on the basis of different performance measures.
